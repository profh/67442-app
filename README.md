# Virtual Caddie | 67-442 iOS Engineering

This goal of this app is to help golfers improve their play by giving them acces to data driven insights into their game.

As a golfer enters a new round, they are optionally prompted to describe several key pieces of information about each stroke. Using geolocation to track the location of each shot as well as these pieces of information that the user enters, Virtual Caddie is able to obtain metrics about the golfer's performance. Currently, only things such as distance, straight flight percentage, and perfect contact percentage are displayed about each club. This enables the user to know exactly what to work on next time they head to the driving range. 

Virtual Caddie aims to function as a professional caddie that fits in your pocket. Moving forward, the plan is for Virtual Caddie to leverage machine learning to use information about the user in addition to crowdsourced data about other users with similar skill levels to give club and strategy suggestions on the course.
